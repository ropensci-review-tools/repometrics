#' From

#' the "Code Commit linked with Change Request" (which is not hyperlinked to
#' anywhere else), is defined as "Percentage of new code commits linked with
#' change request in last 90 days." The interpretation of "Change Request" is
#' defined at \url{https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-change-requests/} as
#' "proposals for modifications to a project's source code that have been
#' submitted for review ... Examples include GitHub 'Pull Request', GitLab
#' 'Merge Requests' and Gerrit 'code reviews'." These are here analysed as
#' merge commits in the git log, even though these may not have been actual PRs
#' on GitHub or similar, and may not have been reviewed.
#'
#' @return A vector of three named numeric values, each measured over the
#' defined time period:

#' \item n_opened = Number of change requests opened.
#' \item n_merged = Number of change requests merged.
#' \item prop_merged = Proportion of all change requests which were merged.
#' \item prop_code_from_prs = Proportion of all code committed by change
#' request.

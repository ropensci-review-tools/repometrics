#' Iusse label inclusivity
#'
#' \url{https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-issue-label-inclusivity/}
#' Based on identifying "the published list of issue labels"
#' \itemize{
#' \item General labels identify general needs of the project (e.g.Feature,
#' Bug, and Documentation)
#' \item Newcomer friendly labels identify issues that are appropriate for
#' first-time contributors (e.g., newcomer, good first issue)
#' \item Skill labels identify skills needed (e.g, Java, Python, HTML, machine
#' learning)
#' }
#'
#' The labels here are taken for issues opened up to the given `end_date`,
#' regardless of when the labels were actually attached. The metrics only
#' consider the "Newcomer friendly" labels, as the "skill labels" are too
#' subjective to automate in a general way here.
#'
#' Note that this also does not consider a "start_date", because the labels may
#' have been added at any time after an actual creation date of each issue.
